## 🚀 Why CacheCleaner?

As developers, we constantly deal with stale cached data during development. Manually going to DevTools → Application → Clear Storage every single time is tedious and breaks your flow.

**CacheCleaner** gives you a single-click broom icon in your toolbar that instantly wipes all site data for your active tab — so you can focus on building, not cleaning.
